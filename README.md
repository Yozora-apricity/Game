Basic 2D Platformer Game (Demo)

This is a demo of a basic 2D platformer game inspired by a 14-hour Python project tutorial by Tech with Tim. The game was built using Python and Pygame.

Acknowledgment:
This project is based on the tutorial by Tech with Tim. All credit for the original code and assets belongs to him. The tutorial can be found on YouTube, and the original code and assets are available on GitHub.

Development Notes:
I encountered Git issues while pushing my game files to the main branch, so I created a new branch called Friend_local. During a rebase, some asset files were accidentally deleted, which required troubleshooting and assistance from friends and online resources. Some original assets from the tutorial are not included in this demo.
