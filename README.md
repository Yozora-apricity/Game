This is a basic 2D demo game Platform.

I got this idea from a 14 Hour Python Project which shows how to create the game.

I encountered some problems with Git so I had to ask some help from my friends and search the internet in solving a problem I am encountering.
I also created a new branch called Friend_local since I had a problem pushing the game file into the main branch.
Additionaly, I encountered a problem where all the assets file got deleted when I tried to rebase it since it won't push to the main branch even after using git pull and git push again.

Note: Some files of the original assets are not included in this demo. 

Additional Note: I do not own this code as well as the other files. All rights reserved to Tech with Tim.
